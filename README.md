# droptimer
hosted at: https://droptimer.herokuapp.com/

Created this site when I had to go from a lasik eye surgery. Used it to mark down intervals of my eye drops, as in, at what time I'll have to put drops again. Input the starting time at which you are putting the drops and then the frequesncy/interval of putting drops. The site will show you all the time in upcoming 24hr in which you'll have to put the drops again.
